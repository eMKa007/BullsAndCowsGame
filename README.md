# BullsAndCowsGame

First console game done via Udemy UE4 course. 

All you have to do is find out hidden word. You have couple of chances, so do not waste them for silly moves.

The aim of creating console game was to get familiar with MS Visual Studio IDE. To get into shortscut, file structure, available customization options, refractoring options.
